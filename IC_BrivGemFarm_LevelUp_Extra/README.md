# BrivGemFarm_LevelUp
## Description:
This Addon will allow to set up maximum champion level settings for the Briv Gem Farm addon.  
It performs the best using **x100** upgrade settings, although in some cases **x25** is preferred to prevent a champion from getting upgrades that would end up being detrimental to performance.
## Briv stacking:
**For stacking purposes:**  
If you're setting Briv's MinLevel to less than level 110 so that he gets Unnatural Haste but not Healing Phlo, set up MaxLevel to 170 and under.  
After stacking, Briv will be leveled back to level 170 to receive MetalBorn.
