# Briv Feat Swap
## Description:
This Addon will allow to use Briv in E formation so you can take advantage of the "save feats with formation" feature to have hybrid jump setups using the Wasting Haste feat (lock at 4J).
You need Briv to be 5J+ to be able to gain an advantage with this feature.

### Setup: 
Enable/Disable the Addon in Addon Management to turn it on/off. It should start/stop whenever you click on the main Briv Gem Farm tab.

## Recommended settings:

#### Advanced Settings Tab: (Q:nJ, E:4J, W:nJ if you are stacking on a checked zone, 4J otherwise)
