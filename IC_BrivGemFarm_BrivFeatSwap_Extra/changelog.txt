October 05, 2023 - v1.5.3

        - If using a preset, advanced settings are correctly loaded/saved.
        - If the game is open while starting ICScriptHub, the Modron reset area will be used
          as the default selection for the stacks calculator reset area.
        - If no preset is selected, the correct walk/jump/stacks values are shown
          when simulating walks in Q or E (targetQ or targetE set to 0).
