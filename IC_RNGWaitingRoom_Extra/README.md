## How to use:
This addon requires ICScripthub v4.0 and the LevelUpAddon.  

Copy and paste the **AddOns/IC_RNGWaitingRoom_Extra/MemoryRead** folder into **AddOns/IC_Core** in the Scripthub folder.

Thellora needs to be removed from the Modron formation if you to stack Ellywick on z1.

Currently, the percent bonus option doesn't work.
