August 23, 2024 - v0.1.1
    - The addon now waits for Ellywick on z1 even if Thellora is not in the Q or E formation.
    - Fixed "Always wait for 5 card draws" setting being ignored.

August 23, 2024 - v0.1.0
    - Added a reset button for stats.
    - Ellywick will use her ultimate early on z1 if there are redraws left and the number of gem cards cannot be achieved without redrawing.
    - Fixes:
        - Disabling "Gem farm mode" doesn't prevent formation switching anymore.
        - LevelUp settings work as intended, and use the "MinLevel" settings while waiting for Ellywick's cards (except Thellora).
        - Thellora doesn't get placed on the field after a forced client restart.
        - The "Always wait for 5 card draws" setting works on the last redraw.

August 15, 2024 - v0.0.4

    - Added setting to wait for 5 card draws before progressing (currently doesn't work after the last redraw)
    - The default value for the "Max redraws" setting is now 1.
    Fixes:
        - Attempt to prevent Thellora from being put on z1 before Ellywick cards are drawn.

August 15, 2024 - v0.0.3
    - Added LevelUp addon (v1.3.4) as a dependency.
