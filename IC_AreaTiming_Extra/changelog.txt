    Complete rewrite of the addon.
    - New features:
        - Launches a separate script to record values. Stats can be viewed as long as the script remains open.

        - Option to start/stop the script when clicking on BrivGemFarm tab buttons.
        - View multiple sessions.
        - View individual runs.

        - Show stacks gained online/offline.
        - Additional average data visualization.
        - Right-click opens a context menu to copy rows (or Ctrl+C).
        - Ctrl+A or double click to select all rows.
    - Fixes:
        - Zone recording being interrupted by scrolling the UI.
