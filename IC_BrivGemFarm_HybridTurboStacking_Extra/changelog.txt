December 03, 2024 - v1.1.3
    - Fixed a case of online stacking being interrupted when Briv had farmed Steelbones stacks beforehand.

November 29, 2024 - v1.1.2
    - Melf, Tatyana and Warden don't require to be levelled up before offline stacking anymore.

November 24, 2024 - v1.1.1
    - Fixed MelfActive setting not getting loaded when reloading ICScripthub.

November 24, 2024 - v1.1.0
    - New features:
        - If both Auto-Detect stacks and IgnoreBrivHaste settigns are off, the script tries to predict Briv stacks left after resetting
          and won't overstack after offline stacking. This also allows Multiple run mode to work properly with Melf.
          NOTE: This doesn't take into account the need for Thellora Rush stacks and assumes values for TargetStacks / MultirunTargetStacks are correct.
        - Added a setting to automatically heal Briv under a certain threshold when stacking online.
        - Added two settings for allowing different setups depending on whether Melf's +spawn effect is active or not:
            1. A setting to have either Melf or Melf + Tatyana + Warden when Melf is active.
            2. A setting to either stack online with Tatyana or offline if Melf is inactive.
        - Added a button in the Melf forecast window to calculate the success rate for the next 10000 resets.
    - Fixes:
        - The script always goes back one zone after stacking online if the current zone has not been completed.
        - The script doesn't throw an error when using an AHK version that doesn't have VerCompare() (1.1.36+).

May 15, 2024 - v1.0.6
    - Added sanity checks to PreferredBrivStackZones settings to avoid online stacking in boss zones.

April 03, 2024 - v1.0.5
    - Requires ICScriptHub v4.
    - Added an updated LV_Colors version that works only if AHK version 1.1.37.02+ is running,
      which should fix crashes when scrolling or resizing the Melf forecast window.

December 01, 2023 - v1.0.4
    - Fixed online stacking with Melf ignoring Preferred Briv stack zones and stacking in the first zone in the range.
